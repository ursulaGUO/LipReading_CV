clip_0000.mp4,thanks very much for joining me Uh
clip_0001.mp4,tonight we're going to do a bad news
clip_0002.mp4,good news routine So stay with me We
clip_0003.mp4,start off with the bad news which is
clip_0004.mp4,pretty bad but we are going to get to a
clip_0005.mp4,happier ending Uh let me begin by just
clip_0006.mp4,uh telling you what you already know and
clip_0007.mp4,that is that under Donald Trump this
clip_0008.mp4,country is h hurtling rapidly toward
clip_0009.mp4,oligarchy toward
clip_0010.mp4,authoritarianism toward
clip_0011.mp4,kleptocracy and toward more and more
clip_0012.mp4,income and wealth inequality That is
clip_0013.mp4,what is happening Uh you'll all remember
clip_0014.mp4,uh that Abraham Lincoln talked about a
clip_0015.mp4,government of the people by the people
clip_0016.mp4,and for the people I think it is very
clip_0017.mp4,clear that today we have a government of
clip_0018.mp4,the billionaire class by the billionaire
clip_0019.mp4,class and for the billionaire class Elon
clip_0020.mp4,Musk contributed
clip_0021.mp4,$277 million to get Donald Trump elected
clip_0022.mp4,president and he was
clip_0023.mp4,rewarded with the most important
clip_0024.mp4,position in government In other words he
clip_0025.mp4,put out the money and he got what he
clip_0026.mp4,paid for Trump also nominated 13 other
clip_0027.mp4,billionaires to head various government
clip_0028.mp4,agencies So almost all the guys who are
clip_0029.mp4,running the government are billionaires
clip_0030.mp4,For many years as I think you know I
clip_0031.mp4,have been talking about how a country is
clip_0032.mp4,moving toward an oligarchic form of
clip_0033.mp4,society And I know that people had their
clip_0034.mp4,doubts What is Bernie talking about well
clip_0035.mp4,not anymore Uh people now see what's
clip_0036.mp4,going on right in front of them No
clip_0037.mp4,secrets about it They're seeing the
clip_0038.mp4,billionaire class running our government
clip_0039.mp4,right now But it's not just oligarchy
clip_0040.mp4,and a government of the very rich that
clip_0041.mp4,I'm concerned about It is a very rapid
clip_0042.mp4,movement toward
clip_0043.mp4,authoritarianism Virtually every day
clip_0044.mp4,Trump is usurping the powers of Congress
clip_0045.mp4,He is ending programs that Congress
clip_0046.mp4,appropriated and he's getting rid of
clip_0047.mp4,agencies that he has no power to get rid
clip_0048.mp4,of Further he has sued major media
clip_0049.mp4,outlets like ABC CBS Meta and the De Mo
clip_0050.mp4,Register for stories and actions that he
clip_0051.mp4,didn't like And now his FCC is
clip_0052.mp4,investigating PBS and
clip_0053.mp4,NPR and he's threatening to withhold
clip_0054.mp4,federal funding for these vitally
clip_0055.mp4,important media outlets This is clearly
clip_0056.mp4,a massive attack on the First Amendment
clip_0057.mp4,and freedom of expression He doesn't
clip_0058.mp4,like what some media are saying and he
clip_0059.mp4,is intimidating them The message is
clip_0060.mp4,clear Hey I'm the boss Don't you dare
clip_0061.mp4,criticize me But it's not just Congress
clip_0062.mp4,and the media that he's going after He's
clip_0063.mp4,also waging a massive attack against the
clip_0064.mp4,judicial system
clip_0065.mp4,Unbelievably he is actually trying to
clip_0066.mp4,impeach judges who render decisions that
clip_0067.mp4,he doesn't
clip_0068.mp4,like Think about it Very few people who
clip_0069.mp4,are watching this discussion tonight
clip_0070.mp4,thought that the Supreme Court's
clip_0071.mp4,decision on Citizens United or Roie Wade
clip_0072.mp4,were good decisions In fact in my view
clip_0073.mp4,they were disastrous decisions But we're
clip_0074.mp4,kind of old-fashioned We believe in the
clip_0075.mp4,rule of law That's what happened
clip_0076.mp4,Presidents appointed those people to the
clip_0077.mp4,Supreme Court We didn't go around saying
clip_0078.mp4,"""Hey you got to impeach Chief Justice"
clip_0079.mp4,"Roberts and the other members."" Terrible"
clip_0080.mp4,decision That's not the way the American
clip_0081.mp4,Constitution works and that's what we
clip_0082.mp4,believe We actually believe in the
clip_0083.mp4,Constitution But it's not just Congress
clip_0084.mp4,or the media or the judiciary that Trump
clip_0085.mp4,is going after He's now waging a
clip_0086.mp4,vitriolic attack against major
clip_0087.mp4,universities that are teaching courses
clip_0088.mp4,or allowing activities he doesn't like
clip_0089.mp4,For years we have heard conservatives
clip_0090.mp4,talk about decentralized government
clip_0091.mp4,getting the government off the backs of
clip_0092.mp4,the people We've heard about education
clip_0093.mp4,being a local issue And now we have a
clip_0094.mp4,president who is telling Harvard
clip_0095.mp4,Colombia Princeton and others what they
clip_0096.mp4,can or cannot do And in an absolutely
clip_0097.mp4,unconstitutional and frightening way
clip_0098.mp4,federal agents have grabbed foreign
clip_0099.mp4,students thrown them into unmarked cars
clip_0100.mp4,and taken them to detention
clip_0101.mp4,facilities And what is their crime what
clip_0102.mp4,have they done that deserves that kind
clip_0103.mp4,of treatment well in at least one case
clip_0104.mp4,uh a woman wrote uh a article critical
clip_0105.mp4,of Israel In another case somebody
clip_0106.mp4,attended a demonstration Do you really
clip_0107.mp4,grab people off of the street throw them
clip_0108.mp4,in unmarked cars take them to detention
clip_0109.mp4,centers because they expressed a
clip_0110.mp4,political point of view and unbelievably
clip_0111.mp4,he is now going after law firms that
clip_0112.mp4,oppose them Giant law firms Can you
clip_0113.mp4,imagine a president threatening a law
clip_0114.mp4,firm because they represented a client
clip_0115.mp4,or did something that you don't like
clip_0116.mp4,and Trump has also decided that he needs
clip_0117.mp4,to lead the culture war in America He
clip_0118.mp4,has made himself chairman of the board
clip_0119.mp4,of the Kennedy
clip_0120.mp4,Center So if you add all of these
clip_0121.mp4,activities up and I'm just talking about
clip_0122.mp4,a small part of what he has done it
clip_0123.mp4,makes one thing very very clear Trump
clip_0124.mp4,has very little respect for the
clip_0125.mp4,Constitution of the United States and
clip_0126.mp4,for the rule of law He wants more and
clip_0127.mp4,more power for himself and his fellow
clip_0128.mp4,billionaires He wants to lead an
clip_0129.mp4,authoritarian
clip_0130.mp4,nation And to make a bad situation even
clip_0131.mp4,worse Trump and Musk are rapidly trying
clip_0132.mp4,to dismember and destroy federal
clip_0133.mp4,agencies that serve working families and
clip_0134.mp4,the poor Musk has laid off thousands of
clip_0135.mp4,workers at the Social Security
clip_0136.mp4,Administration which will make it harder
clip_0137.mp4,for the elderly and the disabled to get
clip_0138.mp4,the benefits that they paid for It's a
clip_0139.mp4,massive attack against Social Security
clip_0140.mp4,Trump and Musk have also decided to lay
clip_0141.mp4,off some
clip_0142.mp4,"83,000 employees at the Veterans"
clip_0143.mp4,Administration which will mean that the
clip_0144.mp4,men and women who put their lives on the
clip_0145.mp4,line to defend our country our veterans
clip_0146.mp4,will see a deterioration in the health
clip_0147.mp4,care they receive at the VA and the
clip_0148.mp4,timeliness of the benefits that they
clip_0149.mp4,earned And then on top of all of that
clip_0150.mp4,Trump and his Republican colleagues are
clip_0151.mp4,now working on a huge reconciliation
clip_0152.mp4,bill which will make massive cuts to
clip_0153.mp4,Medicaid education nutrition etc to do
clip_0154.mp4,what why are they making these cuts in
clip_0155.mp4,order to give over a trillion dollars in
clip_0156.mp4,tax breaks to the
clip_0157.mp4,1% So that's where we are That is the
clip_0158.mp4,bad news and all in all it is a pretty
clip_0159.mp4,dismal
clip_0160.mp4,situation So now let me give you some
clip_0161.mp4,good news some very good news and that
clip_0162.mp4,is over the last month I and my house
clip_0163.mp4,colleague uh Alexandria
clip_0164.mp4,Kaziocortez have been traveling the
clip_0165.mp4,country in what I've called a fighting
clip_0166.mp4,oligarchy tour I've been to Nebraska
clip_0167.mp4,Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Nevada Colorado
clip_0168.mp4,and Arizona and the turnouts have been
clip_0169.mp4,extraordinary Uh in Denver we had more
clip_0170.mp4,than
clip_0171.mp4,"34,000 people turn out the largest rally"
clip_0172.mp4,I have ever been a part of And what I
clip_0173.mp4,have learned from all of these rallies
clip_0174.mp4,and meeting thousands and thousands of
clip_0175.mp4,people is that the people of our country
clip_0176.mp4,are sick and tired of Trumpism They are
clip_0177.mp4,tired of oligarchy They are tired of
clip_0178.mp4,authoritarianism and they are prepared
clip_0179.mp4,to fight back And I should tell you just
clip_0180.mp4,just to mention I'm going to be in uh
clip_0181.mp4,out west uh next week uh in a week and a
clip_0182.mp4,half or so We're going to California and
clip_0183.mp4,other western states and we are going to
clip_0184.mp4,continue to rally the American people to
clip_0185.mp4,stand up to Trumpism and his contempt
clip_0186.mp4,for American democracy And let me give
clip_0187.mp4,you another very good piece of good news
clip_0188.mp4,and and that is on Tuesday night uh
clip_0189.mp4,Susan Crawford uh took on Elon Musk and
clip_0190.mp4,the $25 million that he spent to win a
clip_0191.mp4,seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court And
clip_0192.mp4,I want you all to remember that just
clip_0193.mp4,five months ago uh Trump won a narrow
clip_0194.mp4,victory in Wisconsin And just the other
clip_0195.mp4,day Miss Crawford won a strong victory
clip_0196.mp4,She won by 10 points Pretty good victory
clip_0197.mp4,in a state that Trump had won just five
clip_0198.mp4,months before Also on Tuesday night in
clip_0199.mp4,two congressional districts in Florida
clip_0200.mp4,where Trump had won by 30 points
clip_0201.mp4,Democratic candidates while losing cut
clip_0202.mp4,that margin in half Pretty good So where
clip_0203.mp4,do we go from here
clip_0204.mp4,uh I think the answer is quite obvious
clip_0205.mp4,We have got to educate We've got to
clip_0206.mp4,organize We've got to fight back
clip_0207.mp4,effectively with discipline and
clip_0208.mp4,intelligence And if we do that in my
clip_0209.mp4,view we're going to win this thing And
clip_0210.mp4,right now I should tell you we are not
clip_0211.mp4,only doing rallies around the country We
clip_0212.mp4,are also hiring organizers at the
clip_0213.mp4,grassroots level to help us build the
clip_0214.mp4,kind of grassroots infrastructure that
clip_0215.mp4,we need if we're going to be successful
clip_0216.mp4,And let me just mention to you uh that
clip_0217.mp4,just a few hours ago uh I was on the
clip_0218.mp4,phone with our friends in the first
clip_0219.mp4,district of Iowa I had been to Iowa City
clip_0220.mp4,uh last month and we got a whole lot of
clip_0221.mp4,folks coming out Uh we got names we got
clip_0222.mp4,emails we called them up and we had
clip_0223.mp4,tonight just a few hours ago over 500
clip_0224.mp4,people in the first district of Iowa on
clip_0225.mp4,the telephone and almost all of them
clip_0226.mp4,signed up to get to work to help us
clip_0227.mp4,organize to knock on doors to hold
clip_0228.mp4,meetings etc And we are going to have
clip_0229.mp4,organizers all over this country
clip_0230.mp4,especially in districts where Republican
clip_0231.mp4,members of Congress won by slim
clip_0232.mp4,majorities And we're going to make sure
clip_0233.mp4,that all of the people in those
clip_0234.mp4,districts that were won by Republicans
clip_0235.mp4,with small margins they know loudly and
clip_0236.mp4,clearly they're going to hear from their
clip_0237.mp4,constituents that they must not vote to
clip_0238.mp4,give huge tax breaks to billionaires by
clip_0239.mp4,cutting Medicaid and other programs that
clip_0240.mp4,working families desperately need So yes
clip_0241.mp4,let me be very honest with you Uh the
clip_0242.mp4,oligarchs are enormously powerful No ifs
clip_0243.mp4,buts and may They have endless amounts
clip_0244.mp4,of money They control our economy They
clip_0245.mp4,own much of the media And they have
clip_0246.mp4,enormous influence over our political
clip_0247.mp4,system But from the bottom of my heart I
clip_0248.mp4,am convinced that if we are smart and if
clip_0249.mp4,we're well organized they can be
clip_0250.mp4,defeated If we stand together and not
clip_0251.mp4,let them divide us up by the color of
clip_0252.mp4,our skin or where we were born or our
clip_0253.mp4,religion or our sexual orientation If we
clip_0254.mp4,bring our people together around an
clip_0255.mp4,agenda that works for the many and not
clip_0256.mp4,just the few there is nothing in the
clip_0257.mp4,world that can stop us We can win We
clip_0258.mp4,will win So let us go forward together
clip_0259.mp4,Let's build that movement that we
clip_0260.mp4,desperately need Let's defeat Trumpism
clip_0261.mp4,Thank you all very much
