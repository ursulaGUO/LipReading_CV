1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,440
thanks very much for joining me we are

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,160
living in a dangerous and unprecedented

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,159
moment in American history and I'm

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,718
getting a lot of calls from people who

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,280
are not only upset about what's

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,838
happening but are wondering how we best

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,759
go forward well let me tell you we've

8
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,520
got to be smart we've got to be

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,519
organized and we've got to fight back

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,078
this is not a time for wallowing in

11
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:26,678
Despair and hiding under the covers the

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,638
stakes are just too high we are not just

13
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,998
fighting for ourselves we're fighting

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,680
for our kids for future Generations

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,879
we're fighting for the future of this

16
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,358
planet in the first two weeks of his

17
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:40,318
presidency Donald Trump defied the

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:43,557
Constitution by ending Birthright

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,760
citizenship fired government Watchdogs

20
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,359
allowed drilling along our coastlines

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,358
pen violent insurrectionist suspended

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,599
all foreign aid and tried to cut off

23
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,718
virtually all federal funding so how do

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,199
we go forward first to be effective

25
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,440
we've got to understand what in fact is

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,077
happening around us right now second we

27
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,198
need a short-term strategy what do we do

28
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,720
tomorrow and the next day and the day

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,478
after that third we need a long-term

30
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:13,839
strategy how do we build a movement that

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:16,878
gains political power here is in my view

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,439
a brief overview as to what is happening

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,518
under Trump most

34
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,478
importantly the move toward oligarchy in

35
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,437
our country government run by the rich

36
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:31,279
and the powerful is proceeding rapidly

37
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,117
and it's not being done secretly a

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,919
little over a week ago Donald Trump was

39
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:39,239
inaugurated for his second term standing

40
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,960
right behind them with the three richest

41
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,878
men in the world Elon Musk Jeff Bezos

42
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:48,117
and Mark Zuckerberg men who have become

43
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,678
over $2 billion do richer since Trump

44
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:55,919
was elected and who now are worth almost

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,959
a trillion dollar more money than the

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,118
bottom half of American society

47
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:07,037
70 million people but it's not just

48
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:09,199
oligarchy that we should worry about

49
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,399
this country under Trump is moving

50
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,159
rapidly toward

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,999
authoritarianism just a few examples in

52
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,237
violation of the Constitution and

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,318
federal law Trump attempted the other

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,559
day to suspend all federal grants and

55
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,079
loans that means he blocked funding for

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,159
Medicaid head food stamps homeless

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,360
veterans etc etc tens of millions of

58
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,639
Americans some of the most vulnerable

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,480
people in our country were impacted by

60
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,478
that decision fortunately Americans all

61
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,439
across the country stood up in Outrage

62
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,278
and said no no and with the help of the

63
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,078
courts much but not all of that Freez

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,318
and funding was rescinded you may have

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,080
noticed that Trump is intimidating the

66
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:55,399
media with lawsuits against ABC CBS meta

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,679
and the De Moine register if Trump does

68
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,239
not like what media reports he is

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,199
threatening them with lawsuits

70
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,679
undermining the first amendment that is

71
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,758
a direct movement toward

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,279
authoritarianism now that's a very broad

73
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,318
overview of where we are today in terms

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,720
of short-term strategy we've got to

75
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:17,237
mobilize as strongly as we can against

76
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,999
Trump's dangerous proposals and let me

77
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,878
just say this

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,799
importantly yes the Republicans control

79
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:26,919
the house and the Senate but do not

80
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,159
forget their majorities are small in the

81
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,279
house a body of 435 members they have a

82
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:37,759
four vote majority that is a Raaz within

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,760
margin and their legislation can be

84
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,558
defeated there are a number of

85
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:45,358
Republicans out there who won in

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,760
Democratic districts by small margin so

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,840
let me tell you these guys do respond to

88
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,398
phone calls and emails so if there's a

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,599
piece of legislation you disagree with

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,438
get on the phone and call the capital

91
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:03,437
switchboard at 202 224

92
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,598
2131 and what is some of that

93
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,638
legislation that we should be concerned

94
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,437
about Republicans right now are working

95
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,198
on what's called a budget reconciliation

96
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:16,039
Bill the most important element which

97
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,279
the most important element which would

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,839
be a massive tax break for the wealthy

99
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,239
to be paid for by large Cuts in Medicaid

100
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:28,079
and other programs that Working Families

101
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,720
and low-income people desperately need

102
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,998
at a time of unprecedented Ed income and

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,080
wealth inequality when so many of our

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,440
people are struggling to put food on the

105
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:41,439
table we must not Savage programs for

106
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,719
Working Families to provide huge tax

107
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,079
breaks for

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
billionaires we must vigorously oppose

109
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,119
Trump's efforts at Mass

110
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,838
deportation yes we must strengthen our

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,120
borders yes we should Deport people who

112
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,478
have been convicted of serious crimes

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,999
but no no we cannot destroy families who

114
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,638
have lived and worked in this country

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,679
peacefully for decades not only is

116
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,478
Trump's Mass deportation program immoral

117
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,359
it will have a severely negative impact

118
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,678
on our

119
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,119
economy as all of you know we are seeing

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,840
extreme weather disturbances and

121
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,520
Devastation in our country and all over

122
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,198
the world related to climate change

123
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,358
think about La think about North

124
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,960
Carolina we must vigorously oppose this

125
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,159
absurd drill baby drill Doctrine which

126
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,718
will only make an incredibly dangerous

127
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,639
climate situation even worse and those

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,559
are just a few of the issues that are

129
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,400
coming down the pike but we cannot just

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,600
play defense we have got to be on the

131
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,599
offense please never forget that the

132
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,399
agenda that we are fighting for is

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,119
widely supported widely supported by

134
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,679
Working Families all across this country

135
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,240
and we must continue to fight for that

136
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,399
agenda the American people do not want

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,360
cuts to Medicaid and the privatization

138
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,477
of Medicare they understand that healthc

139
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,919
care is a human right not a privilege we

140
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,317
must continue the struggle for Medicare

141
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:11,438
for all so that every American has the

142
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,240
health care that he or she needs that's

143
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:17,038
not a radical idea that's what Americans

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,079
want federal minimum wage of 7 and a/ qu

145
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,198
an hour is a starvation wage we must

146
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,279
raise that minimum wage to a living wage

147
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,1000
at least $17 an hour if you work 40

148
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,239
hours a week in America you should not

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,839
be living in poverty all over this

150
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,079
country we have a major housing crisis

151
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,159
and it's not just 800,000 who are

152
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,478
homeless it is millions of working

153
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,919
families who are spending 40 50 60% of

154
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,838
their limited incomes on housing instead

155
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,398
of spending almost a trillion dollars a

156
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,638
year on a wasteful and Bloated Pentagon

157
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,519
budget we have got to build millions of

158
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,720
units of low income and affordable

159
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:57,238
housing and when we do that we put large

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,120
numbers of people to work at good paying

161
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,959
union jobs I could go on and on

162
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,639
but let me conclude by saying this the

163
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,197
United States is the wealthiest nation

164
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,198
in the history of the world if we stand

165
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,439
together and oppose right-wing efforts

166
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,1000
to divide us up by our Race by our

167
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,757
religion our sexual orientation or where

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,360
we were born if we stand together there

169
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,999
is nothing that we cannot accomplish

170
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,638
bottom line let us go forward and fight

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,318
for a government and an economy that

172
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,839
works for all not just a few we simply

173
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,799
do do not have the luxury of moaning and

174
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,959
groaning we have got to stand up and

175
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,999
fight back we can do it let's go forward

176
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,999
together thank you very much
