1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
I do not often find myself in the habit

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,118
of thanking Elon Musk but I must confess

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,719
that he has done an exceptional job of

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:12,559
demonstrating a point that a few of us

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,439
have been making for years and that is

6
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,319
the reality that we live in an

7
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:20,238
oligarchic society in which billionaires

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,680
dominate not only our politics and the

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,838
information we consume from media but

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,677
our government and economic lives as

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,358
well that has never been clearer than it

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:33,118
is today by giv the news and attention

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,040
Mr musk has been getting over the last

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,479
few weeks as he illegally and

15
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,838
unconstitutionally dismantles government

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,679
agencies I think it is an appropriate

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,840
time to ask the question that the media

18
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,799
and most politicians don't seem to be

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,920
asking what do he and other

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:56,558
multi-billionaires really want what is

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,160
their endgame in my opinion what musk

22
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,518
and those around them are aggressively

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,479
striving for is not

24
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:05,237
it is not complicated and it is not new

25
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,398
it is what ruling classes throughout

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,960
history have always wanted and have

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:16,040
always believed is theirs by right more

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:18,199
power more control and more wealth and

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,200
they don't want Ordinary People that's

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,959
you and democracy getting in their way

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,719
they want it all Eli musk and his fellow

32
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,878
oligarchs believe government and laws

33
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,598
are simply an impediment an impediment

34
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:37,398
to their interests and what they are

35
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,757
entitled to entitled to in

36
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,280
pre-revolutionary America before the

37
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,360
1770s the ruling class governed through

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,839
a Doctrine called The Divine rights of

39
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:52,278
Kings the belief that the king of

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,840
England was an agent of God and he was

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,158
not to be questioned by mere mortals in

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,158
modern times we no longer have the

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,718
divine right of kings what we now have

44
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,679
is an ideology being pushed by the

45
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:10,998
oligarchs which says that as very very

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,239
wealthy people often self-made often as

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,400
the masters of revolutionary new

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,878
technology it is their absolute right to

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,400
rule in other words these modern-day

50
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:28,958
oligarchs are our Kings and it is not

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,159
just power it's incredible wealth that

52
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:37,318
they have today Mr musk is worth 402

53
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,399
billion Zuckerberg is worth 252 billion

54
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,157
Bezos is worth

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,879
249 billion with combined wealth of over

56
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:48,558
$900

57
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,958
billion these three people three people

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,1000
own more wealth than the bottom half of

59
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,319
American society not surprisingly since

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,040
Trump was elected their wealth has

61
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:04,638
soared musk has become a 100 $138

62
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:08,479
billion richer Zuckerberg has become 49

00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:13,238
billion richer and Bezos has become 28

billion richer all since election

65
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,840
day meanwhile while the very rich become

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,1000
much richer 60% of Americans live

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,479
paycheck to paychecks 85 million are

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,878
uninsured or underinsured 25% of seniors

69
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,998
are trying to survive on $15,000

70
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,597
year or less

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,719
800,000 are homeless and we have the

72
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,399
highest rate of childhood Poverty of

73
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:44,079
almost any major country on Earth do you

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,760
think for one second that the oligarchs

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,679
give a damn about working people trust

76
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:54,999
me they don't musk's decision to

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,439
dismember us Aid means that tens of

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,519
thousands of the poorest people around

79
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:04,359
the world will go hungry or die of

80
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,480
preventable diseases but it's not just

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,560
abroad here in the United States they

82
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,919
will soon be going after the health care

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,798
nutrition housing and educational

84
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,279
programs that protect the most

85
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,159
vulnerable people in our country all so

86
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,878
that Congress can provide huge tax

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,959
breaks for them and their fellow

88
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,279
billionaires as modern-day Kings who

89
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,239
believe they have the absolute right to

90
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,638
rule they will sacrifice without

91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,919
hesitation the well-being of working

92
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,560
people to protect their interests

93
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:44,118
further they will use the enormous media

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,279
operations they own to deflect attention

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,520
away from the impact of their policies

96
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:55,239
while they entertain us to death Mr musk

97
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,559
owns Twitter Mr Zuckerberg owns meta

98
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,600
which includes Facebook and Instagram

99
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,279
and Mr Bezos owns the Washington post

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,720
and twitch further they and their fellow

101
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:11,078
oligarchs will continue to spend huge

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:15,160
amounts of money to buy politicians in

103
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:19,239
both major political parties bottom line

104
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,520
the alars with their enormous resources

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,759
are waging a war against the working

106
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:28,078
class of this country and it is a war

107
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,199
that they are intent on winning now I'm

108
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,758
not going to kid you

109
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:37,639
the problems this country faces right

110
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:40,999
now are extremely serious the economy is

111
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,520
rigged our campaign Finance system is

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,679
corrupt and we are struggling to control

113
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,278
climate change and existential threat to

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,519
our planet among many many other

115
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:57,359
important issues but this is what I do

116
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,038
know the worst fear that the r ruling

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,680
class in this country has is that said

118
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:06,198
Americans black white Latino urban and

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,918
rural gay and straight young and old

120
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,599
that all of us will come together to

121
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:16,038
demand a government that represents all

122
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:19,197
of the people in our country not just

123
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:20,999
the wealthy few the oligarch nightmare

124
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,319
is that we will not allow ourselves to

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,879
be divided up by race religion sexual

126
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,160
orientation or country of origin and

127
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:34,598
will together have the courage to take

128
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,639
them on will this struggle be easy

129
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,838
absolutely not and one of the reasons

130
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,680
for that is that the ruling class of

131
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,959
this country will constantly remind you

132
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,918
that they have all the power they

133
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,598
control the government they own the

134
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,719
media you want to take us on Good Luck

135
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:57,439
they will say there is nothing you can

136
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,559
do about it but our job right now in

137
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,799
these very difficult times is to not

138
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,439
forget the great struggles and

139
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,599
sacrifices that millions of people have

140
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:14,439
waged over the several centuries to

141
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:17,799
create a more democratic just and Humane

142
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:20,278
Society think about it over the last

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,160
number of centuries how many people have

144
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,719
stood up and fought and when they were

145
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,999
doing that you know what their

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,878
contemporaries said they said hey you

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,280
want to overthrow the king King of

148
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,159
England to create a new nation and

149
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,477
self-rule forget about it

150
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,318
impossible you want to establish

151
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,399
Universal sufferage right of all people

152
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,198
to vote impossible can't happen you want

153
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:47,559
to end slavery and segregation

154
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,1000
impossible you want to Grant workers the

155
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,560
right to form unions and end child labor

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
can't be done impossible you want to

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,039
give women control over their own bodies

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,839
who you kiding impossible can't be done

159
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,398
you want to pass legislation to

160
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,037
establish Social Security Medicare

161
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,679
Medicaid at minimum wage clean air and

162
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:10,719
water standards

163
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,479
impossible in other

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,519
words as Nelson Mandela told us

165
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,598
everything is

166
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:23,278
impossible until it is

167
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:26,157
done in these difficult times despair is

168
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,838
not an option we've got to fight back in

169
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,799
every way we can we have to get involved

170
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,477
in the political process run for office

171
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,679
connect with our local state and federal

172
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,240
legislators donate the candidates who

173
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,558
will fight for the working class in this

174
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,799
country we have got to create new

175
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,639
channels for communication and

176
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,478
information sharing we have to volunteer

177
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,919
not just politically but to build

178
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,880
community

179
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:56,719
locally whatever we can do is what we

180
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,879
must do needless to say I intend to do

181
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,838
my part both inside the Beltway and

182
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,879
traveling throughout the country to

183
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,560
stand up for working families and to

184
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:10,199
take on the oligarchy in the days weeks

185
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:14,639
and months ahead I hope you will join me

186
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:19,920
in that struggle we can win we will win

187
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,919
we must win thank you very much
