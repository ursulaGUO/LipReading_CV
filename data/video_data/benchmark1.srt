1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,360
thanks very much for joining me Uh

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,440
tonight we're going to do a bad news

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,238
good news routine So stay with me We

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,239
start off with the bad news which is

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,240
pretty bad but we are going to get to a

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,520
happier ending Uh let me begin by just

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,838
uh telling you what you already know and

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,118
that is that under Donald Trump this

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,079
country is h hurtling rapidly toward

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,159
oligarchy toward

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,598
authoritarianism toward

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
kleptocracy and toward more and more

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,680
income and wealth inequality That is

14
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,077
what is happening Uh you'll all remember

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,438
uh that Abraham Lincoln talked about a

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,920
government of the people by the people

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,397
and for the people I think it is very

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,280
clear that today we have a government of

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,719
the billionaire class by the billionaire

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,879
class and for the billionaire class Elon

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,520
Musk contributed

22
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:04,038
$277 million to get Donald Trump elected

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,119
president and he was

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,839
rewarded with the most important

25
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,759
position in government In other words he

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,080
put out the money and he got what he

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,720
paid for Trump also nominated 13 other

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,718
billionaires to head various government

29
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,598
agencies So almost all the guys who are

30
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:26,797
running the government are billionaires

31
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,118
For many years as I think you know I

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,039
have been talking about how a country is

33
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,638
moving toward an oligarchic form of

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,879
society And I know that people had their

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,159
doubts What is Bernie talking about well

36
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,359
not anymore Uh people now see what's

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,200
going on right in front of them No

38
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,278
secrets about it They're seeing the

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,640
billionaire class running our government

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,999
right now But it's not just oligarchy

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,439
and a government of the very rich that

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,719
I'm concerned about It is a very rapid

43
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,638
movement toward

44
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:05,998
authoritarianism Virtually every day

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,720
Trump is usurping the powers of Congress

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,040
He is ending programs that Congress

47
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,278
appropriated and he's getting rid of

48
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:19,758
agencies that he has no power to get rid

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:24,238
of Further he has sued major media

50
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:28,317
outlets like ABC CBS Meta and the De Mo

51
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:33,879
Register for stories and actions that he

52
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:37,078
didn't like And now his FCC is

53
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:39,679
investigating PBS and

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,080
NPR and he's threatening to withhold

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,519
federal funding for these vitally

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,238
important media outlets This is clearly

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,440
a massive attack on the First Amendment

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,1000
and freedom of expression He doesn't

59
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,038
like what some media are saying and he

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,639
is intimidating them The message is

61
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:04,317
clear Hey I'm the boss Don't you dare

62
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,799
criticize me But it's not just Congress

63
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,119
and the media that he's going after He's

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,159
also waging a massive attack against the

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,919
judicial system

66
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:17,919
Unbelievably he is actually trying to

67
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,478
impeach judges who render decisions that

68
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,518
he doesn't

69
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:27,597
like Think about it Very few people who

70
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,200
are watching this discussion tonight

71
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,317
thought that the Supreme Court's

72
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,399
decision on Citizens United or Roie Wade

73
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,838
were good decisions In fact in my view

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,919
they were disastrous decisions But we're

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,239
kind of old-fashioned We believe in the

76
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,079
rule of law That's what happened

77
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,878
Presidents appointed those people to the

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Supreme Court We didn't go around saying

79
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,797
"Hey you got to impeach Chief Justice

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,199
Roberts and the other members." Terrible

81
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,480
decision That's not the way the American

82
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,679
Constitution works and that's what we

83
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,437
believe We actually believe in the

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,399
Constitution But it's not just Congress

85
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:09,039
or the media or the judiciary that Trump

86
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,480
is going after He's now waging a

87
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,838
vitriolic attack against major

88
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:17,038
universities that are teaching courses

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,519
or allowing activities he doesn't like

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,198
For years we have heard conservatives

91
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,280
talk about decentralized government

92
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,160
getting the government off the backs of

93
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:29,679
the people We've heard about education

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,759
being a local issue And now we have a

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,239
president who is telling Harvard

96
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,800
Colombia Princeton and others what they

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,560
can or cannot do And in an absolutely

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,639
unconstitutional and frightening way

99
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,758
federal agents have grabbed foreign

100
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,440
students thrown them into unmarked cars

101
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,199
and taken them to detention

102
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,038
facilities And what is their crime what

103
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,240
have they done that deserves that kind

104
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,400
of treatment well in at least one case

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,240
uh a woman wrote uh a article critical

106
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,198
of Israel In another case somebody

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,198
attended a demonstration Do you really

108
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,1000
grab people off of the street throw them

109
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,240
in unmarked cars take them to detention

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,198
centers because they expressed a

111
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,079
political point of view and unbelievably

112
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,038
he is now going after law firms that

113
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,197
oppose them Giant law firms Can you

114
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,679
imagine a president threatening a law

115
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,359
firm because they represented a client

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,638
or did something that you don't like

117
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,199
and Trump has also decided that he needs

118
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,440
to lead the culture war in America He

119
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,1000
has made himself chairman of the board

120
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,918
of the Kennedy

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,479
Center So if you add all of these

122
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,959
activities up and I'm just talking about

123
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,878
a small part of what he has done it

124
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,638
makes one thing very very clear Trump

125
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,037
has very little respect for the

126
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,119
Constitution of the United States and

127
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:03,477
for the rule of law He wants more and

128
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,839
more power for himself and his fellow

129
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,519
billionaires He wants to lead an

130
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,799
authoritarian

131
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:15,358
nation And to make a bad situation even

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,758
worse Trump and Musk are rapidly trying

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,560
to dismember and destroy federal

134
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,759
agencies that serve working families and

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,800
the poor Musk has laid off thousands of

136
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,318
workers at the Social Security

137
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,559
Administration which will make it harder

138
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,599
for the elderly and the disabled to get

139
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,560
the benefits that they paid for It's a

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,800
massive attack against Social Security

141
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,159
Trump and Musk have also decided to lay

142
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,758
off some

143
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,879
83,000 employees at the Veterans

144
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,959
Administration which will mean that the

145
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,917
men and women who put their lives on the

146
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,239
line to defend our country our veterans

147
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,477
will see a deterioration in the health

148
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,280
care they receive at the VA and the

149
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:03,279
timeliness of the benefits that they

150
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,998
earned And then on top of all of that

151
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:10,359
Trump and his Republican colleagues are

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,799
now working on a huge reconciliation

153
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:18,159
bill which will make massive cuts to

154
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,719
Medicaid education nutrition etc to do

155
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,520
what why are they making these cuts in

156
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,038
order to give over a trillion dollars in

157
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:29,519
tax breaks to the

158
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:33,438
1% So that's where we are That is the

159
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,839
bad news and all in all it is a pretty

160
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,278
dismal

161
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:42,079
situation So now let me give you some

162
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:45,679
good news some very good news and that

163
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,279
is over the last month I and my house

164
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,559
colleague uh Alexandria

165
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,998
Kaziocortez have been traveling the

166
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,680
country in what I've called a fighting

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,799
oligarchy tour I've been to Nebraska

168
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,439
Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Nevada Colorado

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,439
and Arizona and the turnouts have been

170
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,918
extraordinary Uh in Denver we had more

171
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,477
than

172
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:15,839
34,000 people turn out the largest rally

173
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:18,239
I have ever been a part of And what I

174
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,159
have learned from all of these rallies

175
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,440
and meeting thousands and thousands of

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,440
people is that the people of our country

177
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:30,679
are sick and tired of Trumpism They are

178
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,278
tired of oligarchy They are tired of

179
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,120
authoritarianism and they are prepared

180
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:39,758
to fight back And I should tell you just

181
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,278
just to mention I'm going to be in uh

other western states and we are going to

185
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:55,119
continue to rally the American people to

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,240
stand up to Trumpism and his contempt

187
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,600
for American democracy And let me give

188
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,398
you another very good piece of good news

189
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:09,279
and and that is on Tuesday night uh

190
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:13,200
Susan Crawford uh took on Elon Musk and

191
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:17,598
the $25 million that he spent to win a

192
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,360
seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court And

193
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,560
I want you all to remember that just

194
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,360
five months ago uh Trump won a narrow

195
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,398
victory in Wisconsin And just the other

196
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,360
day Miss Crawford won a strong victory

197
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,399
She won by 10 points Pretty good victory

198
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,919
in a state that Trump had won just five

199
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,240
months before Also on Tuesday night in

200
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,119
two congressional districts in Florida

201
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,680
where Trump had won by 30 points

202
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,398
Democratic candidates while losing cut

203
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:52,879
that margin in half Pretty good So where

204
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,160
do we go from here

205
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:59,159
uh I think the answer is quite obvious

206
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:02,038
We have got to educate We've got to

207
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:04,918
organize We've got to fight back

208
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,598
effectively with discipline and

209
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,239
intelligence And if we do that in my

210
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,640
view we're going to win this thing And

211
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,759
right now I should tell you we are not

212
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,318
only doing rallies around the country We

213
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:22,318
are also hiring organizers at the

214
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,278
grassroots level to help us build the

215
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,760
kind of grassroots infrastructure that

216
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,558
we need if we're going to be successful

217
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,999
And let me just mention to you uh that

218
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,679
just a few hours ago uh I was on the

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,278
phone with our friends in the first

220
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,198
district of Iowa I had been to Iowa City

221
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,758
uh last month and we got a whole lot of

222
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,759
folks coming out Uh we got names we got

223
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:50,957
emails we called them up and we had

224
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:53,759
tonight just a few hours ago over 500

225
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:57,517
people in the first district of Iowa on

226
00:10:53,759 --> 00:11:00,719
the telephone and almost all of them

227
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,519
signed up to get to work to help us

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,559
organize to knock on doors to hold

229
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,440
meetings etc And we are going to have

230
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,919
organizers all over this country

231
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,239
especially in districts where Republican

232
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,239
members of Congress won by slim

233
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,159
majorities And we're going to make sure

234
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,398
that all of the people in those

235
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,359
districts that were won by Republicans

236
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,399
with small margins they know loudly and

237
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,800
clearly they're going to hear from their

238
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,399
constituents that they must not vote to

239
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:37,199
give huge tax breaks to billionaires by

240
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,200
cutting Medicaid and other programs that

241
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,039
working families desperately need So yes

242
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,398
let me be very honest with you Uh the

243
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:51,199
oligarchs are enormously powerful No ifs

244
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,719
buts and may They have endless amounts

245
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,640
of money They control our economy They

246
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,800
own much of the media And they have

247
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,599
enormous influence over our political

248
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:06,799
system But from the bottom of my heart I

249
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,239
am convinced that if we are smart and if

250
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,558
we're well organized they can be

251
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,720
defeated If we stand together and not

252
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,799
let them divide us up by the color of

253
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,319
our skin or where we were born or our

254
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:23,199
religion or our sexual orientation If we

255
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,760
bring our people together around an

256
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,719
agenda that works for the many and not

257
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:32,879
just the few there is nothing in the

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,319
world that can stop us We can win We

259
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:39,119
will win So let us go forward together

260
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,959
Let's build that movement that we

261
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,919
desperately need Let's defeat Trumpism

262
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,918
Thank you all very much
