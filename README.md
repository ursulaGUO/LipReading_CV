# Data 

The data are downloaded from Bernie Sanders' YouTube official account, where I only included videos where only Bernie is talking, and his face is (approximately) in the center. The video resolution is at 480p. 

With the videos, I also downloaded subtitles in txt files.

In `src/preprocess.py`, the code takes in video files in `data/video data` and turns them into frame data in `data/frame data` folder.
